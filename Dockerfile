# A docker setup for DXR development
#
# This image has DXR and various compilers installed, so it can be used for
# indexing, serving web, and interactive debugging.
#
# This image should not be used as a base for production setups. Those would
# want separate images (and separate machines) for indexing. Also, we leave out
# some image size optimizations and introduce would-be security holes for the
# sake of a good dev experience.
